		<h1>Freelance Web Designer for Barcelona</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Lukasz Adam and I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a> Web Design Service <strong>Freelancer</strong>, who provides affordable <strong>web design solutions</strong> to other freelancers, agencies, entrepreneurs or for your personal projects. I do web development, UI design, UX design & SEO Marketing. My Web Design service extend throughout the <strong>Barcelona area</strong> (including Girona, Tarragona, Montserrat, Santa Susana, Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrú).
		<br><br>
		Since I am a Freelancer, I very often meet my lovely customers in <strong>Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera,</strong> because it is not so crowded 
		like Barcelona’s touristic parts -la rambla-, especially in the summer months. However I am also able to work remotely from all parts of the world.</p>

		<h2>Inspiring Web Design & Development</h2>

		<p>Inspired by Barcelonas beautiful nature like the Llobregat and the Besòs river, my goal is to provide Antoni Gaudis Hometown with individualised solutions for web design, web development, wordpress customisation & search engine optimization (on-page as well as off-page seo).
		<br><br>
		Whether it be for an individual like an entrepreneur, a personal trainer, or a famous blogger. I can help you to fulfil your project with a personalized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a> design, a personal solution for <strong>hosting</strong> (without monthly costs) and I can make your website come alive with my favourite <strong>coding language</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript (ES6).</a> Furthermore I can take a look at your homepage and provide it with an engaging <strong>User Experience</strong>. My goal is to leave the web a better place. Since I am already talking about User Experience, one thing that goes hand in hand with UX is <strong>SEO Marketing.</strong> SEO solves a VERY common problem most webmasters suffer from: traffic.
		<br><br>
		I am <strong>Barcelonas Freelancer</strong> here to help you with your online world. Don't hesitate to <a href="contact">drop me a message.</a></p>
