		<h2>Freelance Web Development Service</h2>
		<p>As a Barcelona based Freelancer, I am offering fast, professionell and clean Web Development  throughout the whole area of Barcelona. I code Markup with HTML, CSS (Cascading Stylesheets) & Code with Vanilla Javascript ES6. I am also able to write PHP Code, which is a server site language mostly used for dynamic pages like WordPress.</p>

		<p>There is nothing that I outsource and I don’t work with WYSIWYG Software. Specialised as a Front-End Developer, I am able to code pages with CMS like WordPress or with a static site generators like Jekyll along with GitHub Pages.
		<br><br>
		I make sure your page will work with every common browser like Chrome, Edge, Safari or Firefox. Of course I make sure that Internet Explore can handle the code as well.
		<br><br>	
		The Text Editor I use is Sublime Text and I follow all the important rules from the World Wide Web Consortium. Clean Code and is essential for a good working page. There are tons of libraries, which make coding pages much easier, sometimes you just don’t need to re-invent the wheel, however in most cases, I don’t use libraries like Bootstrap. 
		<br><br>
		I like my code to be fully personalised for your needs. For my CSS Markup I am using the css preprocessor SASS. 
		<br><br>
		If you need a E-Commerce Website I code the Front-End in conjunction with WooCommerce & WordPress. WordPress is great for dynamic Pages.
		<br><br>
		If you use a static page, which is a page that doesn’t work with a database, I will help you to create a GitHub Account and I will create your Page with the static Site generator Jekyll. With this interaction you are able to host your pages on GitHub, which works with one of the most reliable and safest server in the world.
		</p>

		<h2>Advantages of a static page:</h2>

		<ul class="ul-list">
			<li>Free Premium Hosting with GitHub Pages..</li>
			<li>No Database.</li>
			<li>Since you don’t work with a database, you don’t get hacked.</li>
			<li>Pretty Fast because, again - No Database.</li>
			<li>Very good for SEO Marketing.</li>
		</ul>
