            <p class="left">My name is Lukasz Adam. I code, I design and I optimise pages to increase their traffic. 
                I solve problems, to help others create their vision online. It doesn't matter, if you need something new or if you need help 
                with something you already created, I am sure I can help, to find the best way to achieve your goal. 
                <br><br>
                One specialty that you can expect from me, is that I work fast, efficiently and that I create my User Interfaces 
                for websites with lots of illustrations and colors. The website needs to breath, that is why I make sure to 
                add enough White Space to it.
                <br><br>
                You know the feeling when you land on a website, and think to yourself: 
                “Wow, this is a clean modern approach”. From my point of view, this is the 
                best way to present your product or service.
                <br><br>
                I love to learn new languages and that is what brought me to Barcelona. Even I wasn’t born in this great city, 
                I never felt more home like in Barcelona. The first time I’ve visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_G%C3%BCell">Park Güell</a> or the Sagrada Familia, I was impressed by all the beautiful colors. 
                Catalonia's capital is a city is a full of life. As a Freelancer, after designing and coding a website, 
                there is nothing more relaxing than enjoying the view from <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playa_de_la_Barceloneta">Barcelonetas Beach.</a>
                <br><br>
                There are lots of great Designers, Entrepreneurs and Startups emerging from Barcelona, that is why it is such 
                a great place to work as a Freelancer. With its 1.6 million people, there is always a new project to begin with.
                <br><br>
                I love to travel and that’s why I spend my time on several places all over the world. 
                I love to work with people from all over the world and I love to inspire them and teach 
                new things to them as well as learning new things for myself. 
                <br><br>
                If you like to know more about me, please feel free to contact me anytime you like. 
                Just use my Email or my Social Media channels.</p>
